# 05-planner

## Description

This is a simple work day scheduler that helps showcase my newly acquired skills of using web APIs. 

For this project I used dayjs to display the local day and time with a clock that refreshes every second. 

I have time blocks for each standard work day hour where a user can type information and have it saved into local storage. 

When the browser is reloaded, this data persists and is displayed on the page. 

## Installation
